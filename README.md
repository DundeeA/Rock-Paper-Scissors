## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Jquery
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

 My biggest take away from this project was the experiance gained with Jquery. This is the first project I 
 have completed with the library. I already had prior experiance working with DOM manipulation using vanilla js which is an important skill to have, but Jquery is very usesful for doing the same amount with less lines of code.
